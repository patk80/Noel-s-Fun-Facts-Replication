            <h3>What is this site?</h3>
            <p>This site is a just a silly side project made by me, <span class="havard-name">Håvard Brynjulfsen</span>. It's a collection of my favorite fun facts. You see, I have a tendency to blurt out random fun facts at parties or when hanging out with friends. Despite the high quality of the facts some of my <span class="best-striketrough">best</span> former friends claim that they aren't excactly fun. I beg to differ.</p>

            <h3>Why the name "noel.fun"?</h3>
            <p>A stand-up comedian once had a bit about the struggle of choosing baby names and pleaded that his wife wouldn't name their son "Noel" because it sounded like the name of a person who would spew out fun facts at a party. Alas, my nickname is now "Noel".</p>

            <h3>What's a "classic go-to"?</h3>
            <p>Some facts are more fun than others. The classic go-tos are my personal favorites. Awkward silence? Hit them with a classic!</p>

            <h3>Do you have any sources to back these facts?</h3>
            <p>This is just a personal blog of mine. I've obviously read or heard them somewhere, so you'll just have to take my word for it.</p>
